# Godot Color Preview Addon

`! Note:` this plugin only works for Godot 4.x

Made in 4.0.alpha3. Things may change and break with other Godot versions.

Now avalable on the Godot Asset Library: [Color Preview](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1252)

## Installation
1. In the Godot Editor, got to the `AssetLib` tab
1. Search for 'Color Preview', select and <kbd>Download</kbd>
1. Select only the `addons/ColorPreview` folder and <kbd>Install</kbd>

**Or**:

1. Download/Pull this repository
1. Add the `ColorPreview/` directory and its contents to the `addons/` directory in your Godot project

## Enabling the addon
Go to `Project > Project Settings... > Plugins` and <kbd>Enable</kbd>


Once you have done this, every line containing a Color will have a preview left of the breakpoint gutter.
Click any preview to open a color picker where you can edit the color directly.
