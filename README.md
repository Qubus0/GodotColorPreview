# Godot Color Preview Addon

`! Note:` this plugin only works for Godot 4.x

Made in 4.0.alpha3. Things may change and break with other Godot versions.

## Using the Addon:

1. Download/Pull this repository
1. Add the `ColorPreview/` directory and its contents to the `addons/` directory in your Godot project
1. Enable the plugin in `Project > Project Settings... > Plugins > Enable`

Once you have done this, every line containing a Color will have a preview left of the breakpoint gutter
